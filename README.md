ProjectEuler
============
An Android application that connects to projecteuler.net. 
It displays a users progress, allows a user to solve any problem 
and provides full offline access to the complete list of ProjectEuler questions. 

I built this app because in my first week of being a Eulerian, I became really addicted to the website. 
I was trying to plan the next problem each morning during my bus ride to work. 
I even ended up printing the first 50 questions. 
So I wrote this app to make it easier for me to keep track of my progress, to help me plan my next problem and to save trees.
